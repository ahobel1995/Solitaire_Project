  To make a move:
  1) Type the column # of the card you'd like to move (1-7 for Tableau, 
      0 if pulling from stock)
  
  2) (OPTIONAL, ignoring this step will simply select the lowest card from 
      the column you selected) 
      Type the row # of the card you'd like to move (1-19). If there are 
      descending cards beneath your row selection, they will be moved too. 
      If you entered 0 for step 1, always skip this step. 
  
  3) Type the column # you'd like to move your selected cards to (1-7 for 
      Tableau, 8 for foundation. You can only move a single card to the
      foundation at a time.
  
  Make sure to add no spaces.
  Ex: Entering 2174 takes the card at column 2, row 17 and moves it to the 
       bottom of column 4.
      Entering 08 takes the top card from the stock pile and places it in 
       the foundation.
